# Custom Panels

This is a ![Blender](https://blender.org) addon used to
_easily create ui panels_ in the 3d viewport.

The features are meant to help blender asset creators and asset users
leverage the power of custom properties and operators during their workflow
without having to write any python themselves
(except to write any new operator of course).

## Installation

The releases are available in github's
[release tab](https://github.com/clembu/custompanels/releases).
Unless you know what you are doing, you shouldn't have to unzip the archive.

Installation instructions can be found in the
[Blender manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#installing-add-ons).
